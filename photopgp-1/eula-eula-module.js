SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATIONS ON THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  10. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE PHOTOPGP OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES FOR: (a) PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (b) DIRECT DAMAGES IN AMOUNTS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR PHOTOPGP.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  11. Indemnification.\n\n  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys\u2019 fees, arising from or relating to your use or misuse of PhotoPGP or your breach of this Agreement. Furthermore, you agree that Company assumes no responsibility for the content you submit or make available through PhotoPGP.\n\n  12. Export Regulation.\n\n  PhotoPGP may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You will not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export or release PhotoPGP to, or make PhotoPGP accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export or release is prohibited by law, rule or regulation. You will comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing or otherwise making PhotoPGP available outside the US.\n\n  13. US Government Rights.\n\n  PhotoPGP is commercial computer software, as such term is defined in 48 C.F.R. \u00A72.101. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to PhotoPGP as are granted to all other end users under license, in accordance with\n\n  (a) 48 C.F.R. \u00A7227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. \u00A7227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or\n\n  (b) 48 C.F.R. \u00A712.212, with respect to all other US Government licensees and their contractors.\n\n  14. Severability.\n\n  If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.\n\n  15. Arbitration of Disputes.\n\n  Any and all disputes, controversies or claims (each a \"Dispute\") arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, any dispute regarding its arbitrability, validity or termination, or the performance or breach thereof, will be exclusively and finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") before a single arbitrator. Either party may initiate arbitration by notice to the other party (a \"Request for Arbitration\"). The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA rules governing commercial arbitration in effect at the time of the arbitration, except as they may be modified by the provisions of this Agreement. The place of the arbitration will be Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of the Commonwealth of Kentucky without reference to its internal conflicts of laws principles and will be without power to apply any different substantive law. The arbitrator will render an award and include the costs related to the arbitration and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the prevailing party. The parties waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any rights to appeal, or to review of, any arbitrator\u2019s award by any court. The arbitrator\u2019s award will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES SUCH PARTY\u2019S RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE AN ARBITRATOR\u2019S DECISION OR AWARD PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ALSO AGREES THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality as to all aspects of the arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law, regulations or court order; provided, that nothing herein will prevent a party from disclosing information regarding the arbitration for purposes of enforcing the award.\n\n  16. Limitation of Time to File Claims.\n\n  ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR PHOTOPGP MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.\n\n  17. Entire Agreement.\n\n  This Agreement and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to PhotoPGP and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to PhotoPGP.\n\n  18. Waiver.\n\n  No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement will govern.\n");
